MixFA(mixed method formative assessment) dataset




## over view of the dataset
We present descriptive statistics of the mixFA dataset. There are on average 17 codes (representing unique student ideas) in each question, indicating that emerging student ideas and reasoning go beyond the options in MCQs. There are on average 22\% correct MCQ answers with wrong explanations and 47\% wrong MCQ answers with correct explanations. The reason behind the relatively high percentage of wrong MCQ answers with correct explanations is that students may select incomplete answers in multiple select questions and write correct explanations for what they had understood. And the correct MCQ answers with wrong explanations are due to students presenting some misconceptions beyond the knowledge shown in MCQ options. The mismatch between the correctness of the answers and the correctness of the explanations suggests that the free-text explanations provide additional insights into students' prior knowledge and misconceptions.

Overview of the Dataset. The data analysis is based on informative explanations (remove non-informative explanations).  The percentage of right answers with wrong explanations (RAWE) is (RAWE)/right answer (same with the wrong answer with right explanations)
